# Telegram Bot which retrieves the free games from the Epic Games Store

## This project is in no way associated or affiliated with the Epic Games Store. 

I made this so that I could send my friends and myself reminders on Telegram including links to the games which are currently free or coming soon.

Requires the pip packages python-telegram-bot and selenium (use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all of the dependencies/packages necessary). Also requires Firefox and geckodriver.
