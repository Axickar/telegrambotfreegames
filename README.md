# Telegram Bot which retrieves the free games from the Epic Games Store

## This project is in no way associated or affiliated with the Epic Games Store. I made this so that I could send my friends and myself reminders on telegram including links to the games which are currently free or coming soon.

Requires the pip packages python-telegram-bot and selenium. Also requires Firefox and geckodriver.
